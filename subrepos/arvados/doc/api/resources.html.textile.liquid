h2. Object UUID

Each object is assigned a UUID.  This has the format @aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccccccccccccc@.

# The first field (@aaaaa@ in the example) is the site prefix.  This is unique to a specific Arvados installation.
# The second field (@bbbbb@ in the example) is the object type.
# The third field (@ccccccccccccccc@ in the example) uniquely identifies the object.

h2. Timestamps

All Arvados timestamps follow ISO 8601 datetime format with fractional seconds (microsecond precision).  All timestamps are UTC.  Date format: @YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS.SSSSZ@ example date: @2016-11-08T21:38:24.124834000Z@.

h2. ETags

fn1. Each response includes an ETag, a string which changes when the resource changes.  Clients can use this to check whether a resource has changed since they last retrieved it.  If a previous ETag is provided along with a request, and the resource has not changed since, the server may return a "not modified" response.
