Now that you've finished the Getting Started guide, check out the "User Guide":{{site.baseurl}}/user/index.html. The User Guide goes into more depth than the Getting Started guide, covers how to develop your own pipelines in addition to using pre-existing pipelines, covers the Arvados command line tools in addition to the Workbench graphical interface to Arvados, and can be referenced in any order.
