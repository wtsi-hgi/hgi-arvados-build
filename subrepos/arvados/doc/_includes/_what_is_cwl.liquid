The "Common Workflow Language (CWL)":http://commonwl.org is a multi-vendor open standard for describing analysis tools and workflows that are portable across a variety of platforms.  CWL is the recommended way to develop and run workflows for Arvados.  Arvados supports the "CWL v1.0":http://commonwl.org/v1.0 specification.
