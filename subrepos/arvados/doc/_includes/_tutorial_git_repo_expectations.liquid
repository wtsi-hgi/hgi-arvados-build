This tutorial assumes that you have a working Arvados repository. If you do not have a repository created, you can follow the instructions in the "Adding a new repository":{{site.baseurl}}/user/tutorials/add-new-repository.html page. We will use the *$USER/tutorial* repository created in that page as the example.
