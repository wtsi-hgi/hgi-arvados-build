This method is intended for evaluation and development on a local workstation. It is not suitable for production use in a cluster deployment.

{% include 'notebox_begin' %}
* The automatic network configuration allows you to log in to Workbench from a browser _running on the same host as Docker_. Connecting from other hosts requires additional configuration (not covered here).
* Your data will be stored inside the Docker containers.  You may stop and restart the containers without loss, but if you delete the container, your data will be gone.
* Updating the Arvados software inside the Docker containers is not supported.  You may download updated Docker images, but migrating data to updated containers is not yet supported.

h2. Prerequisites

# A GNU/Linux x64 (virtual) machine
# A working Docker installation (see "Installing Docker":https://docs.docker.com/installation/)
# curl

h2. Verify prerequisites

Make sure that @curl@ and @docker@ are installed on your system, and that you are in the docker group (see "Installing Docker":https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

<notextile><pre><code>~$ <span class="userinput">which curl</span>
/usr/bin/curl
~$ <span class="userinput">docker.io --version</span>
Docker version 1.2.0-dev, build dc243c8
~$ <span class="userinput">groups</span>
yourusername sudo fuse docker
</code></pre></notextile>

h2. Download and install Arvados.

<notextile>
<pre><code>~$ <span class="userinput">\curl -sSL get.arvados.org | bash</span>
</code></pre></notextile>

This command will download the latest build of the Arvados docker images. It also gets the @arvdock@ command and saves it in the current working directory. It then uses @arvdock@ to spin up Arvados. Note that the Arvados Docker images are large and may take a while to download.

If you prefer, you can also download and inspect the installation script before running it. @get.arvados.org@ redirects to "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curoverse/arvados-dev/master/install/easy-docker-install.sh":https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curoverse/arvados-dev/master/install/easy-docker-install.sh, which is the installation script.

The @arvdock@ command usage is listed here:
