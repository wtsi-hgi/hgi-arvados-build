# cloud nodes.  For example, the SLURM dispatcher drains nodes
# through SLURM before shutting them down.
#dispatcher = slurm

# Node Manager will ensure that there are at least this many nodes running at
# all times.  If node manager needs to start new idle nodes for the purpose of
# satisfying min_nodes, it will use the cheapest node type.  However, depending
# on usage patterns, it may also satisfy min_nodes by keeping alive some
# more-expensive nodes
min_nodes = 0

# Node Manager will not start any compute nodes when at least this
# many are running.

# Upper limit on rate of spending (in $/hr), will not boot additional nodes
# if total price of already running nodes meets or exceeds this threshold.
# default 0 means no limit.

# If Node Manager can't succesfully poll a service for this long,
# it will never start or stop compute nodes, on the assumption that its
# information is too outdated.
poll_stale_after = 600

# If Node Manager boots a cloud node, and it does not pair with an Arvados
# node before this long, assume that there was a cloud bootstrap failure and
# shut it down.  Note that normal shutdown windows apply (see the Cloud
# section), so this should be shorter than the first shutdown window value.
boot_fail_after = 1800

# "Node stale time" affects two related behaviors.
# 1. If a compute node has been running for at least this long, but it
# isn't paired with an Arvados node, do not shut it down, but leave it alone.
# This prevents the node manager from shutting down a node that might
# actually be doing work, but is having temporary trouble contacting the
# API server.
# 2. When the Node Manager starts a new compute node, it will try to reuse
# an Arvados node that hasn't been updated for this long.

# time to shut down a node is right before a new hour of uptime starts.
# Shutdown windows define these periods of time.  These are windows in
# full minutes, separated by commas.  Counting from the time the node is
# booted, the node WILL NOT shut down for N1 minutes; then it MAY shut down
# for N2 minutes; then it WILL NOT shut down for N3 minutes; and so on.
# For example, "54, 5, 1" means the node may shut down from the 54th to the
# 59th minute of each hour of uptime.
# Specify at least two windows.  You can add as many as you need beyond that.

# You can define any number of Size sections to list EC2 sizes you're
# willing to use.  The Node Manager should boot the cheapest size(s) that

# Each size section MUST define the number of cores are available in this
# size class (since libcloud does not provide any consistent API for exposing
# this setting).
# You may also want to define the amount of scratch space (expressed
# in GB) for Crunch jobs.  You can also override Amazon's provided
# data fields (such as price per hour) by setting them here.
#
# Additionally, you can ask for a preemptible instance (AWS's spot instance)
# by adding the appropriate boolean configuration flag. If you want to have
# both spot & reserved versions of the same size, you can do so by renaming
# the Size section and specifying the instance type inside it.
